## Triangle-Barycentric-Algorithm
# Summary
This is a program to take in irregularly shaped triangles and determines if a given coordinate falls within it's area. The user manually defines the triangle using a window, then places a point. Using the Barycentric Algorithm, this project will determine if that point is inside the triangle's bounds, outside, or stradling the edge of that triangle.

# How to use
1. Once compiled, the program will display an empty window.
2. Click on any 3 random parts of this window. Once you've clicked the 3rd point on this window, the triangle will appear.
3. Now determine a place to put the 4th point. Once clicked, text will appear in the top-left explaining where this point is in relation to the triangle.

   NOTE: Program does not allow user to override previously input coordinates, to fix a mistake (or run the program again), close the window and compile again.
